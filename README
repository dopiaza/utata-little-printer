Utata on Little Printer
=======================

Utata on Little Printer is an example of extracting content from a Wordpress database and generating a Little Printer publication from it. This code isn't meant to be used as-is (it's rather specific to Utata), but it demonstrates how to publish Wordpress content, and also retrieve photos from Flickr and processing them for publication. It should be very easy to modify to allow publication of your own content from Wordpress.

A brief overview:

Utata publishes original writing and photography every weekday at http://www.utata.org/. A photo is selected from the Utata group pool on Flickr and one of the staff writers writes a few paragraphs to accompany it. This content is stored in Wordpress.

This Little Printer publication takes the latest post from the Wordpress blog, and formats it for Little Printer. It also uses the Flickr API to retrieve the URL of the Flickr photo and details of the photographer, and includes those in the publication.

One of the trickiest things about publishing this kind of material to Little Printer is making sure that arbitrary photos will render well. I've found that I get better result by converting the photo to greyscale and resizing to the correct size first, rather than letting BERG cloud do all the conversion automatically. This code uses ImageMagick to perform that processing. 

To get the Flickr integration up and running, you'll need to get an API key from Flickr and edit and rename the apikey.sample.php file to apikey.php. Each Wordpress post should have a custom field called 'photoId', which contains the Flickr ID of the photo (that's the long number you see at the end of the Flickr URL for the photo page). This code uses my DPZFlickr library. It's already included here, but you can find the latest version at https://github.com/dopiaza/DPZFlickr.

Modify sample.php and edition.php to use the correct blog id by modifying the switch_to_blog(2) line (or delete the line if you have a single site blog).


You'll also need to update your server config to map  /sample/ and /edition/ onto sample.php and edition.php respectively. There are various ways to do this, I have the following in my server config:

RewriteRule ^/berg/sample/?$    /var/www/utata/berg/sample.php  [L]
RewriteRule ^/berg/edition/?$   /var/www/utata/berg/edition.php  [L]
Alias /berg/ /var/www/utata/berg/

For the conversion to grayscale to work, you will need ImageMagick installed, and to create the relevant directories. You'd need an images directory inside your publication directory, and within that, two subdirectories called 'original' and 'converted'. These directories will need to be writable by the web server.

And that's probably about it. Have fun!
